## About

A project with the ability to view flags of all countries from the API https://restcountries.com/

Also, viewing the art of the whole world from the API is implemented https://api.artic.edu/docs/#introduction

## Documentation

This project goes like a learning story with many tools and capabilities for Android application development.

From the very beginning, I started learning development from simple things without using architectural patterns and libraries for DI.

Then, with each branch, I started adding more complex and interesting things to this project.

Currently, the MVVM architecture is implemented, Dagger Hilt is used for DI, Retrofit (for REST requests) + Glide (for receiving and inserting images) is used to get data from the API, the Room database is used to store data in the application, Gson is used for Json parsing, viewbinding is used for ease of accessing UI elements
